# Code Snippets

This directory contains various code snippets that I've written or studied as part of my software development journey. These snippets are organized into categories such as Algorithms, Data Structures, and Design Patterns. Each category serves as a quick reference and a showcase of implementation techniques in different programming languages.

## Contents

- [Algorithms](Algorithms)
  - Key algorithmic concepts like sorting and searching algorithms.
- [Data Structures](Data_Structures)
  - Implementation of fundamental data structures like trees and graphs.
- [Design Patterns](Design_Patterns)
  - Examples of common design patterns in software engineering.

## Algorithms

In the [Algorithms](Algorithms) directory, you'll find implementations of various algorithms. This includes classic sorting algorithms like Quicksort and Mergesort, as well as search algorithms like Binary Search.

## Data Structures

The [Data Structures](Data_Structures) directory contains implementations of basic to advanced data structures. This includes trees, such as binary trees and AVL trees, as well as different types of graphs.

## Design Patterns

The [Design Patterns](Design_Patterns) directory includes examples of common design patterns in software development, like the Singleton and Factory patterns. These are provided in different programming languages to show various implementation approaches.
